This is a simple Quiz App created by me (Olayide Majoyeogbe ;)) to test the user's knowledge of Figures of Speech.
It's not for beginners, though. I've been told the questions are tough.

It's a single-screen scrollable app and is properly formatted for portrait and landscape orientation.

It's also fully localised in French.
